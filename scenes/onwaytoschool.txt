As you drive to school, it's hard to concentrate on the road, but you manage by focusing very intently. At a stoplight, you take the opportunity to relax, storing up the energy to concentrate again later, and while sitting there, you wonder how odd it is that you're not hungry. You're always hungry. Ravenous, even, due to your high metabolism from all the strength and cardiovascular conditioning from your daily workouts. As soon as you think these thoughts, you seem to sense a different kind of hunger, something more whole-body rather than just in the stomach. It's almost sexual, a kind of lust, but instead of wanting a girl, you want something else that you can't quite put your finger on. The object of your attraction seems to be both men and women, and it seems you almost want to bite them, which strikes you as extremely odd. Are you developing a fetish? Is this how it happens?

The light changes, so you put these thoughts aside, focusing again on the road, which constantly threatens to slip from your mind. You feel that you could appear normal at school, talking and joking as usual, and will only come into play with more difficult mental tasks. You're confident that if you concentrate, you can drive safely and handle your classes. You won't be an A student, of course, but then again, you never were.

As you drive, your new hunger seems to be getting stronger, and you find it harder and harder to keep your eyes on the road and away from all the luscious pedestrians and other drivers. 

Nearing the school, your eyes alight upon a woman sitting at a bus stop. She's wearing a black coat with a black fur hat and is quite attractive, yet you don't have the desire to bite her, which is so strange that you slow down to look at her, wondering what's different about her. As you pass by, she looks directly at you and smiles, almost as if she were watching for you, and then that's when you notice her long red hair! Could this be the woman from last night? Though you only saw her briefly from a distance, her height and body type seem similar. With a subtle motion of her head, she asks you to approach, so you park the car as close as you can. She greets you with a smile and slow nod, her piercing green eyes never leaving yours.

"By now, I trust you're hungry," she says, and you're unsure if it's a question or not.

You look this mysterious woman up and down, trying to glean as much information as you can before you respond. You notice that her clothing is impeccable and expensive with a slightly old world, vintage look to it. Her demeanor shows a cool confidence, almost aristocratic and bordering on haughtiness, but at the same time, she has a sultry quality hinting at a raw sensuality burning just beneath the surface.

This MUST be the woman from last night. Your reaction to this woman is...

You wonder how this strange woman could possibly know about the odd, powerful hunger you're experiencing when you yourself only noticed it a few moments previous. You try to reply in a way that will both get some answers and help you in your interactions with her in the future.

"I'm feeling something LIKE hunger, that's for sure!" you say, sincerely, hoping she will elaborate.

The woman touches your shoulder comfortingly. "Something terrible has been done to you, and I intend to not only help you but punish those responsible. Shall we get in your car and talk about it? I will tell you everything you need to know."

"Yes, lead the way," the woman responds, smiling and already walking toward your car. 

*if strategy = "suspicious"
	You can't help but wonder if you're falling right into her trap, but you plan to go along with it for now.

The woman merely chuckles at your vulgar remark. Frankly, you were expecting a slap in the face, but she laughs it off, saying, "Oh, you silly boy. Don't you know there are wonders far greater in this world than that little thing between your legs? There is so much I can teach you, but the question is, Do you wish to learn?"
*goto raunchy3

*label suspicious-clever2 
*label angry-clever2 

You're not sure, but you think your daring, baseless claim caused the woman a tiny moment of hesitation. However, she seems completely unfazed when she challenges, "Oh really? Tell me, then, what do you know?"

	# "Why should I?"
	# "I know why you ran last night, and I know why you were there."
	# "I know you're behind everything that's going on with me, and it's all part of your sick plan."
	
"You're speaking vaguely, boy," the woman laughs. "You don't know a thing. Wouldn't you really like to know what's going on?"

*choice
	# Give in. Say, "Yes."
		"Then let's get in your car and talk further. Yes?"
		*goto questions3
	# Try to continue the charade.
		The woman is exceedingly sharp and doesn't fall for your ruse, merely responding to each vague statement with a probing question. You'd meant to try and take control, but she's managed to turn it around completely, putting you on the defensive.
		
		You:

You decide to switch to a new tactic:

"You have some nerve, boy," the woman says coldly. "I was going to help you but not anymore."

She turns and walks away.
*goto made_her_mad

*label angry-insulting2 
The woman's face turns red, and she seems too angry too speak.

Finally, her voice is low and cold. "Good luck."

She turns and walks away.

	*set reason_made_her_mad "She was probably up to no good anyway."

	# Chase after the woman and apologize

		"I'm sorry," you call out, trotting to keep up.
		
		"That's better," the woman says warmly, turning back to face you. "Shall we talk about things in your car?"

*label angry-aloof2

The woman looks at you pointedly, obviously not liking your tone. Finally, she smirks disdainfully and says, "I'm offering to help you, but perhaps I shouldn't bother."

She turns and walks away.

	# Let her go. You'll figure things out on your own.
		*goto school
	# Curse at her as she walks away
		You shout rude obscenities to the woman's back as she walks away.
		
		As you keep it up, finally, she stiffens, pauses, then turns. "You'll regret that," she says, her face ashen, her hands visibly shaking with anger. She seems almost about to lose control but then quickly turns and resumes walking away at a faster pace.
		*goto school

"Calm yourself," the woman snaps. "I will answer your questions if you ask them nicely."

		You keep up your barage of questions.
		
		*goto angry-aloof2
	# Stay angry and insult her
		"What is wrong with you, lady?" you hiss. 
		
		*goto suspicious-insulting2
	# Insult her BAD
		"You need some serious help, lady. Go look up 'psychiatrist' in the phone book. It's under, 'P.'"
		
		The woman's face turns beet red. 
		
		"You'll regret that," she says, her hands visibly shaking with anger. She turns and stalks off.
